Peer's repository: https://github.com/ddredmon/03-Text-adventure



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
    Being able to restart the game after a game over.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
    Honestly I really enjoyed the varied descriptions of the rooms. Also the
    restart function / "death-loop."
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    Code is good, but I would take out the moves & points system since
    it was not implemented in the final product.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    How to gain points and/or "complete" the game (unless dying and trying again is the point,
    which is fine).
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    No, the code is pretty clean.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    YES
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    Background on the world? Just a thought. Or perhaps what it is you are trying to accomplish
    (they did this by saying it is a death-loop, meaning the ending is to die upon escape)
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    Code is very clean! I actaully really enjoyed the descriptions of the rooms, and
    honestly would love to see a longer version (perhaps with a good ending??).
